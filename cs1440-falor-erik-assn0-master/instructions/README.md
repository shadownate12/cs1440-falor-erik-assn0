# `instructions` directory

This directory contains instructor-provided documentation.

*   `Instructions.md` - The requirements of the assignment
*   `Rubric.md` - What each requirement is worth to your grade.  The same information as is found on Canvas.
*   `Hints.md` -  Miscellaneous time-saving ideas.  Scan this when you get stuck.
*   ...and other files depending on the project.

Please leave this directory as-is in case the instructor needs to send out corrections.

Documentation that you author belongs in `doc/`.
